This is a simple plugin for WordPress that makes it easier to add a Fancy Box to a post or page. Easy FancyBox (https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-fancybox/) allows a user to make content show in a pop-up on a post or page.  This custom plugin makes it even easier to do that by using shortcodes that have the FancyBox class pre-set for iframe.  Since my site needed alot of FancyBoxes, this allowed me to use the shortcode to change only the link to the content.  The content can be either a pageID on your site or it can be a multimedia object (image, video, pdf, etc.).
